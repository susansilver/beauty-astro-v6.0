Hello everyone, it is the next Carnival of Mathematics featuring blogs from the month of May 2025. I'm always happy when I get a chance to host.
Though, my own blog hasn't updated for awhile due to life circumstances. Which I think people can understand. I would like to write at least one piece this month.
We will see what happens.

Now, on to this month's Carnival.

## Carnival of Mathematics #240

Here is what people sent in.

1. This [question on the Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5062119/coincidental-patterns-in-logs-of-repeating-decimals-e-g-ln2-3-vs-l) was submitted. It answers a discovery about logs and repeating decimals.
2. This [blog from The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2025/04/birthday-effect/) discusses the birthday effect. Read on to find out what that means.
3. This [post from Gr√©goire Locqueville](https://glocq.github.io/en/blog/20250324/) talks about something that I have seen a lot online. I think there was even a Numberphile about it.
4. This year Mathematician Masaki Kashiwara was awarded the Abel Prize. This blog is about his [work in representation theory](https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/an-introduction-to-representation-theory/).
5. We have two posts from John D. Cook.

- This one about [stacking cannonballs](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/05/30/stacking-cannonballs/).
- And this one on [exponent and log notation](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/05/13/alternative-exp-and-log-notation/).

6. This [article talks about some interesting statistics of flipping a coin](https://www.skewray.com/articles/how-to-unflip-a-coin). I love the title, "How to unflip a coin".
7. Fractal Kitty has started a new series on guided inquiries in mathematics. The [first one discusses overlapping circles](https://www.fractalkitty.com/inquiries-week-1-circle-shading/).
8. This post is [in memoriam of Mario Biagioli](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2025/05/23/mario-biagioli-1955-2025/) who recently passed.
9. This [quiz was developed for International Women in Mathematics day](https://ganitcharcha.com/quiz-page-name-view-Women-in-Mathematics-Day-Celebration-2025.php). Do you know the answers?
10. This post from Josh Millard was submitted [all about 5x5 nonograms](https://mastodon.social/@joshmillard/114603428745700494).

That's all for this edition. Next month is being hosted by the Aperiodical. You [submit your blogs for the Carnival of Mathematics 241 there](https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/).
